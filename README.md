### Running

We have included a maven made sh script to launch a bundle application on any platform regardless of the java
and java fx installed versions.

On the main directory run:

```
./exec/script.sh
```

### Instructions

* Use the keypads arrows to move your view.
* Or simply hit spacebar to enter view mode to change view using the mouse.
* Use the mouse scroll to zoom in and out.
* Hover your mouse over a celestial object to get it's name printed on the bottom pane.
* Animate the time with the play/pause and reset buttons.

### Our features

Most of the features are shared between all classmates who did the project, however some of them
are specific to our team, such as:

* View movement with the mouse.
* Rendering the asterisms names.
* City auto complete box search using a prefix tree.
* Rendering the background sky color differently according to the sun elevation.
* Minor aesthetic improvements.
* Builded a bundle allowing the user to run the code on any platform regardless of their java version.
